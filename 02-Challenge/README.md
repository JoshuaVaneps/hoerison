## Description
Optomized a codebase for a Marketing Agency so that follows accesibility standards 
and can be optomized for search engines. 


## Usage
When You view the source code you will find semantic elements in the correct structure 
of the HTML elements.  You will find that the elements follow a logical structure independent 
of styling and positioning.  All icons, and images have been given accessible alt attributes and
all heading attributes are now in sequential order.  Lastly when you view the title element
you will find a descriptive title.
